# Zeplin open in app
**Redirects Zeplin web links to zpl:// app protocol**

This is a small extension that intercept all the requests on `https://app.zeplin.io/project/(...)` and redirects to the equivalent `zpl://screen?sid=(...)`, so you don't have to worry anymore about non-clickable links and teammates without the Zeplin app.

Learn more about Zeplin here: https://zeplin.io/
